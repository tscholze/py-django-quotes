## What's Quotes?
Quotes is my very first Django project. It is a simple quote storage. Quotes helps me to understand how Django and the Python ecosystem works and how to handle stuff like database, data migration, Json or Rss export, etc...

## How to install
1. Check if Django 1.8 is already installed
1. Clone this repository
1. Create database migration script with `python manage.py makemigrations`
1. Perform database migration with `python manage.py migrate`
1. Go to [http://localhost:8000/quotes](http://localhost:8000/quotes/) -> An empty site shows up
1. Go to [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) to create new entries
1. Go back to the Quotes app and hit refresh -> The latest ten quotes show up
